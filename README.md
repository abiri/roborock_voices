# Roborock Voices
Additional voice packs for the Roborock S50 by Xiaomi.

## Guide
Voice packs have been created following guide lines on [Kaeni](https://kaeni.de/deutsche-sprachpakete-fuer-den-roborock-sweep-one/).

### IP and Token
To get the token, install version `5.4.49` of the "Xiaomi Home" app, available [here](https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/xiaomi-inc/mihome/mihome-5-4-49-release/mi-home-5-4-49-android-apk-download/).
It stores the token in its log, which can be accessed on an Android phone at `/sdcard/SmartHome/logs/plug_DeviceManager/2020-xx-yy.txt`.

### Mirobo
`win-mirobo` version `1.1.0` can be downloaded from its creators on [roboter-forum.com](https://www.roboter-forum.com/index.php?thread/25361-win-mirobo-eigene-sprachpakete-installieren/).

### Sounds
Trump sounds can be downloaded from [Soundboard 101](https://www.101soundboards.com/boards/10035-donald-trump-soundboard). View the page source and search for the `download` link at the very bottom. Other `.wav` sounds are used for the Samir voice pack. 

To convert `.mp3` to `.wav`, you can use `ffmpeg`, available as a Linux package and [Win executable](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows).
